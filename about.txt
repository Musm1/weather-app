Packages used:
1: react v18
2: tailwind css
3: luxon
4: react-toastify

Tasks Completed:
1: Completed implementing the weather app
2: message displayed correctly when data is fetched. 
3: DArk mode implemented.
4: Display weather description (e.g., sunny, rainy, etc.) implemented
5: Show an appropriate icon/image based on the current weather implemented
6: Display additional info: humidity, wind speed, etc.

Tasks that couldnt be completed due to open weather api restrictions and some other things:
1: couldnt fetch daily and weekly timestamps because they blocked the feature and are requiring money.
2: didnt implement redux or context api cause there was no need to fetch the api from there.
3: due to certain packages like luxon or toastify the app couldnt be uploaded timely on vercel thats why i only uploaded it to github.
